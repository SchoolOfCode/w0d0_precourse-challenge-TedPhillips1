## Alan Turing Tribute Page README

### Why I Chose Alan Turing

I chose to do my tribute page on Alan Turing because I wanted to learn more about his life.
Although he is an inspiration and a commonly known name for many today, in his lifetime he didn't get the recognition he desrved. 
His story is also heartbreaking due to the challenges he faced as a homosexual man in a time where homosexuality was illegal.
I also love the movie [The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/ "The Imitation Game")!

### What I Learned Along The Way

As this was my first project I learned a lot of useful HTML and CSS that will come easier with more practice.
If I had to highlight the main areas that I learned they would be, how to organise HTML with landmarks and elements as well as how to center and responsively resize elements using CSS. 
More specifically the landmarks I used were `<header>`, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. 
I used the class: 
```
  .center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 700px;
  height: auto;
  }
  ```
to center and responsively resize my image and caption. 

## Reflections

- Enjoyed the CSS 
- Will get better with practice
